# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the existing Job and Application models to properly represent a job posting and job application system. The current Application model appears to be designed for invite codes rather than job applications, so it needs to be restructured to support a proper job application workflow with applicant tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want to submit applications to job postings with my resume and cover letter, so that I can be considered for employment opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an applicant submits a job application THEN the system SHALL store the application with a unique ID
2. WHEN an applicant submits a job application THEN the system SHALL link the application to both the applicant's user ID and the specific job ID
3. WHEN an applicant submits a job application THEN the system SHALL require a resume link and allow an optional cover letter
4. WHEN an applicant submits a job application THEN the system SHALL set the initial status to "Applied"
5. WHEN an applicant submits a job application THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp of submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hiring manager, I want to track the status of job applications through different stages, so that I can manage the hiring process effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hiring manager reviews an application THEN the system SHALL allow updating the status to "Reviewed"
2. WHEN a hiring manager schedules an interview THEN the system SHALL allow updating the status to "Interview"
3. WHEN a hiring manager makes a hiring decision THEN the system SHALL allow updating the status to either "Rejected" or "Hired"
4. WHEN the application status is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity with proper enum validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the models to have proper database tags and relationships, so that data is stored efficiently and relationships are maintained correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application model is defined THEN it SHALL have proper GORM tags for database mapping
2. WHEN the Application model is defined THEN it SHALL have proper JSON tags for API serialization
3. WHEN the Application model is defined THEN it SHALL have foreign key relationships to User and Job models
4. WHEN the Job model is updated THEN it SHALL have proper tags and field naming consistency
5. WHEN models are used in database operations THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the models to follow consistent patterns with the existing codebase, so that the code is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the models are updated THEN they SHALL follow the existing Base struct pattern for ID and timestamps
2. WHEN the models are updated THEN they SHALL follow the existing DTO pattern separation
3. WHEN the models are updated THEN they SHALL use the existing enum patterns for status fields
4. WHEN the models are updated THEN they SHALL maintain consistency with existing field naming and tag conventions
